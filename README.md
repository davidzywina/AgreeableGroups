# AgreeableGroups

This is Magma code for the preprint: *Open image computations for elliptic curves over number fields*

Currently the repository contains the data of the 11972 agreeable subgroups of GL(2,Zhat), up to conjugacy, that have genus at most 1.  The file `main.m` loads these precomputed groups and computes the numerical values in Theorem 1.2 and in the table of the preprint.

In the folder `Precomputation` is the code for computing these groups. It took 58 minutes on my department's machine to perform these computations.
