This folder contains data derived from the Cummins and Pauli (https://mathstats.uncg.edu/sites/pauli/congruence/) classification of low genus congruence subgroups.   The data file "CPdata.dat" is produced from theirs by running "PrepareCPdata.m" in a directory with their Magma code.

Our data file contains all open subgroups of SL(2,Zhat), up to conjugacy in GL(2,Zhat), that contain -I and have genus at most 24.  
The Cummins-Pauli data describes congruence subgroups up to conjugacy in GL(2,Z)(!!), so after some group theory our list will be shorter.
